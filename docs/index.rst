Evolution of Language and Information Technology
======================================================

The ELIT project brings the latest natural language processing (NLP) technology to the community.
The primary focus of this project is to present an end-to-end NLP framework that is scalable for big data analysis using rich resources in the cloud.
ELIT facilitates the process of developing, accessing, and deploying cutting-edge NLP tools by
allowing researchers to quickly prototype innovative ideas using plug-and-play modules,
supporting web-APIs to access built-in models, and
providing a cloud platform to deploy comprehensive systems.
ELIT is developed by the `NLP Research Group <http://nlp.mathcs.emory.edu>`_ at Emory University with an active collaboration with the AWS `MXNet <https://mxnet.incubator.apache.org>`_ team.
