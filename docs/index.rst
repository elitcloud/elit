Evolution of Language and Information Technology
======================================================

The ELIT project brings the latest natural language processing (NLP) technology to the community.
The primary focus of this project is to present an end-to-end NLP framework that is robust across various domains as well as scalable for big data analysis.
ELIT is developed by the `Emory NLP <http://nlp.mathcs.emory.edu>`_ with an active collaboration with the `GluonNLP <https://gluon-nlp.mxnet.io/>`_ team.
