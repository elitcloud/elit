The ELIT project brings the latest natural language processing (NLP) technology to the community.
The primary focus of this project is to present an end-to-end NLP framework that is robust across various domains as well as scalable for big data analysis.
ELIT supports python APIs for developers to integrate our framework to their platforms as well as web APIs for researchers to take advantage of our cutting-edge models without local installation.
ELIT is under the `Apache 2 <http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0>`_ license and developed by `Emory NLP <http://nlp.mathcs.emory.edu>`_ with an active collaboration with `GluonNLP <https://gluon-nlp.mxnet.io/>`_.

* Latest release: `0.2 <documentation/release_notes.html#0.2>`_.
